# Why

+ I don’t use normal password managers:
    - I don’t want a company handling all my passwords. They can get hacked, or they could misuse the data.
    - Auto-fill is a security risk. If someone gets access to my unlocked computer, they can sign in to any account I have.
    - Setting up a password manager every time I change my OS, switch Linux distros, or reinstall my system is annoying. I don’t want extra steps just to log in to basic sites.

+ I already use a simple encryption script to store my passwords. This project is a cleaner, safer, more user friendly version of that idea.
+ With this tool, I can unlock all my passwords with just one master password. I can also store the vault and the tool in a USB stick and use it on any computer without installing anything or signing in.
+ This gives me full control. No cloud service, no third-party risks, and no worries about my passwords leaking if someone else gets hacked.
