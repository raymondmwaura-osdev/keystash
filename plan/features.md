### Primary Features

+ Allow the user to add passwords (`add`).
  - Have the following fields:
    - `service`: The site, e.g. `github`, `leetcode`.
    - `username`: User's username on the site. Example: `yomama123`.
    - `password`: The password to the site.
    - `email`: The email used to sign in to the site.

  - Have switches for specifying these fields:
    - `-s/--service` for `service`.
    - `-u/--username` for `username`.
    - `-p/--password` for `password`.
    - `-e/--email` for `email`.

  - If the user doesn't use those switches, ask for the fields individually. Example:
    
    ```
    $ keystash add

    ```

      {
        "service": "github",
        "username": "yomama123",
        "password": "lk*['kaD23",
