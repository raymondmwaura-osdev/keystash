storage.py

This module provides functions for reading and writing JSON files with built-in
support for symmetric encryption and decryption using a master password.

The module integrates with the `crypto_utils` module to handle key derivation
and cryptographic operations based on the `cryptography` library. Encrypted data
is stored in a text-safe format using Base64 encoding to ensure compatibility
across different storage systems and text editors.

Functions:
    - write_json(contents, file, encrypt=True, master_password=None):
        Serializes and writes JSON data to a file, optionally encrypting it
        using a key derived from a master password.

    - read_json(file, encrypted=True, master_password=None):
        Reads JSON data from a file, optionally decrypting it using the same
        master password and format produced by `write_json()`.

Encryption Format:
    When encryption is enabled, the file contents are stored as a single
    Base64-encoded record in the following format:

        <base64(salt)>:<base64(ciphertext)>

    The salt is used to derive a unique encryption key for each file, ensuring
    that identical passwords produce distinct encrypted outputs. The ciphertext
    represents the encrypted JSON data.

Notes:
    - Attempting to encrypt or decrypt without providing a master password will
      raise a ValueError.

    Read and deserialize JSON data from a file, optionally decrypting the contents.

    This function reads the specified file and converts its contents back into
    a Python object (list or dictionary). If the file is encrypted, the function
    uses the provided master password to derive the decryption key and restore
    the original JSON data. The function expects encrypted files to follow the
    format produced by `write_json()`:

        <base64(salt)>:<base64(ciphertext)>

    Parameters:
        file (pathlib.Path): The path to the JSON file to read.
        encrypted (bool, optional): Indicates whether the file is encrypted.
            Defaults to True.
        master_password (bytes, optional): The master password used to derive
            the decryption key. Must be provided if `encrypted` is True; should
            be None otherwise.

    Returns:
        list | dict: The deserialized Python object (list or dictionary) loaded
        from the JSON data.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `encrypted` is True but no master password is provided.

    Notes:
        - Encrypted files must have been written using the corresponding
          `write_json()` function with encryption enabled.
        - When reading unencrypted files, the content is read and parsed as
          plain JSON without any cryptographic processing.

    Serialize and write JSON data to a file, optionally encrypting the contents.

    This function converts the given Python object (a list or dictionary) into
    a JSON-formatted string and writes it to the specified file. If encryption
    is enabled, the JSON string is first encrypted using a key derived from the
    provided master password. The salt and ciphertext are Base64-encoded and
    written to the file as a single text record in the format:

        <base64(salt)>:<base64(ciphertext)>

    Parameters:
        contents (list | dict): The data to serialize as JSON.
        file (pathlib.Path): The path to the target JSON file.
        encrypt (bool, optional): Whether to encrypt the data before writing.
            Defaults to True.
        master_password (bytes, optional): The master password used to derive
            the encryption key when `encrypt` is True. Must be provided if
            encryption is enabled; should be None otherwise.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `encrypt` is True but no master password is provided.

    Notes:
        - When encryption is disabled, the JSON text is written in plaintext.
        - When encryption is enabled, the resulting file is not valid JSON
          but a text-encoded cryptographic container that must be decrypted
          before parsing as JSON.
